Shortly, I will start as a PhD candidate with Chris Olivers and Johannes Fahrenfort. Together we will investigate what kinds of representation can serve as attentional template in visual search.

Having used Opensesame during my studies, I am very happy to have gotten the chance to contribute to its development. I think many researchers could benefit from using this powerful and easy-to-use tool.
