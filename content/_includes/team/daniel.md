I have always had a fond interest in both technology and human cognition and therefore studied 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), which combines these two disciplines. During this time, I was mainly drawn towards the 
'what makes people tick' side of AI and therefore chose to continue with a master's degree in Cognitive Science.
In this area I also graduated for my PhD Degree at the VU University of Amsterdam, where I currently work as a post-doc.
During all this time, I  never lost my interest in computer science and kept up to speed with the latest developments in this area.
I'm very happy I can apply my knowledge of these two fields in a pragmatic way by assisting Sebastiaan with the development of OpenSesame.
