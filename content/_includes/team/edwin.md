Edwin currently is a master student in Neuroscience and Cognition, as well as a research and teaching assistant at Utrecht University. He has bundled OpenSesame with a portable version of Python, resulting in OpenSesame Portable. A 'run from anywhere' distribution that has helped him and his colleagues immensely in both teaching and research. Being young and idealistic (perhaps a bit too much from time to time), Edwin is a strong believer in the principles of open source software and open access publishing. He thinks OpenSesame is a great example of how open source software can be of great quality and can come with good support as well, therefore giving the public a great alternative to – often very expensive – commercial products.
