I am currently a master student in Computer Science at Radboud University of Nijmegen. For the OpenSesame project, I develop the OpenSesame online version. 

With the online version of the project, we expect to widen the range of of possible test subjects from people living not too far from research facilities to a potentially world wide audience.
