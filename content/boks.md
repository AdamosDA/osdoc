The Boks is an open-source response box for use in psychological and neuroscientific experiments. The hardware is developed by [responseboks.eu](http://www.responseboks.eu/), a Dutch electronics company. The software is developed by the OpenSesame community. Part of the price is a direct donation to the OpenSesame project, so your purchase of the Boks helps to maintain OpenSesame!
