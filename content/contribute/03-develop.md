The OpenSesame source code is hosted on GitHub:

- <https://github.com/smathot/OpenSesame>.

GitHub provides a straightforward way for collaborating on a project. If you're not familiar with GitHub, you may want to take a look at their help site: <http://help.github.com/>.

The best (and easiest) way to contribute code is as follows:

- Create a GitHub account.
- Create a fork of OpenSesame <https://github.com/smathot/OpenSesame>.
- Modify your fork.
- Send a 'pull request', asking for your changes to be merged back into the main repository.

The two main branches of OpenSesame are:

- `master` contains reasonably stable code.
- `playground` contains potentially unstable code.
