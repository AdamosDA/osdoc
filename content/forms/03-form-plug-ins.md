A number of commonly used forms are available as ready-made plug-ins. These allow you to drag some commonly used forms into your experiment, without any need for scripting.

- **form_consent** is a simple digital consent form (disclaimer: some journals may require *written* consent)
- **form_multiple_choice** allows you to present multiple choice questions
- **form_text_display** is a simple text display that you can use to show instructions etc.
- **form_text_input** is a simple text input display that allows you to ask a question and collect a multi-character response from the participant

The **form_base** plug-in is a bit special. It allows you to define custom forms using OpenSesame script, as described [here][custom-forms].
