## Using an Android tablet

For information about the OpenSesame runtime for Android, see:

## Using a Windows XP/ Vista/ 7 tablet

There are a number of tablets available that run a regular installation of Windows XP/ Vista/ 7, rather than a mobile operating system. These tablets are essentially just laptops sans keyboard, and thus allow you to run OpenSesame in the same way that you would on a regular computer. Unfortunately, such tablets are rare and relatively expensive.

## Using an iPad

It is not possible to run OpenSesame on the iPad. The iPad does not appear to be very Python-friendly, and it will therefore not be easy to port OpenSesame to the iPad.
