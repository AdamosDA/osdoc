For OpenSesame 0.27, a lot of effort has been put into making OpenSesame friendly to non-western alphabets. Depending on the alphabet, you may need to select a custom font in the font-selection box. For example, for the screenshot below, I used the font *Droid Sans Japanese*. After you have selected the proper font, working with non-western alphabets should be straight-forward.

That being said, this functionality has not been tested extensively. If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to post your question on the [forum].
