Using OpenSesame for teaching
-----------------------------

Because OpenSesame can be freely downloaded by, and distributed among, students, it is an attractive tool for teaching. Quite a few universities are now using OpenSesame as part of courses on programming and research methods. On this page, I would like to offer (links to) teaching resources: tutorials, assignments, etc. If you are using OpenSesame in class and have some material that you would like to share, please contact me or leave a message on the [forum][]!
