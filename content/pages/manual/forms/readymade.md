A number of commonly used forms are available as ready-made plug-ins. These allow you to use common forms, without any need for scripting.

- FORM_CONSENT is a simple digital consent form (disclaimer: some journals may require *written* consent)
- FORM_MULTIPLE_CHOICE allows you to present multiple choice questions
- FORM_TEXT_DISPLAY is a simple text display that you can use to show instructions etc.
- FORM_TEXT_INPUT is a simple text input display that allows you to ask a question and collect a multi-character response from the participant

The FORM_BASE plug-in is special. It allows you to define custom forms using OpenSesame script, as described here:
