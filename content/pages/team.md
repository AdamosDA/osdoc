title: Meet the team!

OpenSesame is mainly developed by a loose collection of individuals. But anyone is welcome to contribute!

I'm currently a Marie Curie fellow at the Laboratoire de Pyschologie Cognitive in Marseille, France. My research focuses on the relationship between the pupillary light response, visual attention, and eye movements.

OpenSesame is the more pragmatic side of my job. With this project, we aim to provide experimental psychologists and neuroscientists with a free (in every sense of the word) high quality experiment builder.

I have always had a fond interest in both technology and human cognition and therefore chose to study Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is a combination of these two disciplines. During this time, I was mainly drawn towards the
'what makes people tick' side of AI and this led me to follow a master's degree in Cognitive Science. In this area, I also graduated for my PhD Degree at the VU University of Amsterdam, where I have worked as a post-doc. During all this time, I never lost my interest in computer science and kept up to speed with the latest developments in this area. Currently, I am working as a freelance software developer for scientific projects.

I am happy I can assist Sebastiaan in the development of OpenSesame, as it allows to keep doing more pragmatic tasks like software development
which I really like, and at the same time lets me stay involved in psychological research.

I'm working as a PhD student under supervision of Françoise Vitu at the Laboratoire Psychologie Cognitive at the Aix-Marseille Université. My PhD project is on whether affordances (possibilities for action in our environment) influence how and where we move our eyes.

I really enjoy being involved in the OpenSesame project, from helping with the documentation to offering support on the forum. So don't hesitate to post any questions!

I'm currently a PhD student at Oxford University. For the OpenSesame project, I maintain the affiliated PyGaze package for eye tracking.

Being young and idealistic, I am a strong believer in the principles of open source software. I think OpenSesame is a great example of how open source software can really be a good alternative to - often very expensive - commercial software.

I am a PhD candidate with Chris Olivers and Johannes Fahrenfort. Together we investigate what kinds of representations can serve as attentional templates in visual search.

Having used Opensesame during my studies, I am very happy to have gotten the chance to contribute to its development. I think many researchers could benefit from using this powerful and easy-to-use tool.

Hi! I am a PhD student at the Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive in Marseille. I'll happily contribute in finding a solution to any problem you might encounter while realizing your experiment (or whatever it is you want to use OpenSesame for - heck, you could even make games with it!)
