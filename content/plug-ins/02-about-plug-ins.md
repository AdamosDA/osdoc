You can extend OpenSesame's functionality by adding plug-ins. Plug-ins integrate with the graphical user interface (GUI) and appear as additional items in the item toolbar, just like the core (or 'commonly used') items. The main use of plug-ins is to allow OpenSesame to make use of external devices, such as eye trackers and response button boxes, and to add convenient, time saving functionality.
