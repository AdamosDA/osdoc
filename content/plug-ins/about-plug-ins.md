You can extend OpenSesame's functionality by adding plug-ins and extensions.

## Plug-ins

Plug-in are additional items for your experiment. They integrate with the graphical user interface (GUI) and appear as additional items in the item toolbar, just like the core (or 'commonly used') items. Plug-ins extend the functionality that is at your disposal for creating experiments. For example, OpenSesame doesn't automatically support joysticks, but you can use the *joystick* plug-in, which offers this functionality.

## Extensions

Extensions extend the OpenSesame user interface, but (unlike plug-ins) do not provide additional functionality that you can use in an experiment. For example, the *quick_switcher* extension allows you quickly open items and execute actions through a keyboard-controlled menu.
