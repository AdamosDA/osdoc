### CombiTVA

This is an open implementation of the CombiTVA paradigm [(Vangkilde, Bundesen & Coull, 2011)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00213-011-2361-x) in OpenSesame.

### Conjunctive continuous performance task

Conjunctive Continuous Performance Task (CCPT) is a sustained attention test developed and validated by [Shalev et al (2011)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002839321100251X). This is the visual variant of the CCPT implemented in OpenSesame.

## Adding your own task

If you have implemented a task that you feel has a high re-use potential, we want to know about it! You can have your task included in this list in two ways:

1. Edit this page on GitHub, add your experiment, and send a pull request. To do this, you need to have a GitHub account.
	- <https://github.com/smathot/osdoc/blob/master/content/standard-tasks.md>
2. Drop a note on the forum to let us know about your experiment.
