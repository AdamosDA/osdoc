## Creating a cat-faces experiment

The video below introduces the basic functionality of OpenSesame by providing a step-by-step walk-through for creating a 'cat-faces' experiment. In this experiment, the participant's task is to judge whether a (picture of a) cat is male or female. Quite tricky (the task, that is, creating the experiment is easy), but apparently people can do it after some training.

- Duration: 43 minutes
- OpenSesame version: 0.27.2
