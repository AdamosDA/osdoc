Creating a cat-faces experiment {#cat-faces}
-------------------------------

The video below introduces the basic functionality of OpenSesame by providing a step-by-step walk-through for creating a 'cat-faces' experiment. In this experiment, the participant's task is to judge whether a (picture of a) cat is male or female. Quite tricky (the task, that is, creating the experiment is easy), but apparently people can do it after some training. This video has been created by [Chris Longmore][chris-longmore].

- Duration: 43 minutes
- OpenSesame version: 0.27.2

Creating an affordances/ orientation experiment {#affordances}
-----------------------------------------------

The video below shows how to create a typical 'affordances/ orientation effect;-type experiment in OpenSesame in slightly over 5 minutes. This video is not intended to be a full tutorial (see [here][tutorial] instead), but to give you an idea of how OpenSesame works. The experiment is based on Symes et al. (2005, Vis Cog). You can download the experiment that is created in the video here (contains images by Rossion & Pourtois, 2004).
