## Allowed responses

The *Allowed responses* field indicates a list of allowed responses. All other responses will be ignored, except for 'Escape', which will pause the experiment. The allowed responses should be a semicolon-separated list of responses, such as 'a;left;/' for a `keyboard_response`. To accept all responses, leave the *Allowed responses* field empty.
