I'm currently a Marie Curie fellow at the Laboratoire de Pyschologie Cognitive in Marseille, France. My research focuses on the relationship between the pupillary light response, visual attention, and eye movements.

OpenSesame is the more pragmatic side of my job. With this project, we aim to provide experimental psychologists and neuroscientists with a free (in every sense of the word) high quality experiment builder.
